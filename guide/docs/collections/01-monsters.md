# Monsters

![Monsters 1 Image header](/img/monsters-1-twitter-header.jpg)

The first ever collection. 

## Ticket price

The price of each ticket is tied to $3 US dollars, but the purchase will be made in the network's main currency (such as ETH for Ethereum, MATIC for Polygon, FTM for Fantom, or BNB for Binance). Achieved thanks to [Chainlink price feed↗](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/) oracles.

:::tip
To identify the condition of a cap in percentage, simply use the rule that the first number represents a sealed condition and the last number represents 0% condition.

For example: YETI with [`conditionId`](../getting-started/05-check-your-caps-balance.md#using-block-explorer) 243 is 100.05% (sealed), YETI 244 is 100%, YETI 245 is 99.50%, and so on.
