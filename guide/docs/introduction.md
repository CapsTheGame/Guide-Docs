# What is CAPS?

**CAPS** is a decentralized, [full-cycle](./blog/about-full-cycle-concept/) NFT collectible game that aims to implement Web3 standards in a fun and engaging way.

Players can collect caps, which are similar to the milk caps that many of us remember from the game in the 90s. Each collection production is limited, for example, ["Monsters 1"](./collections/01-monsters.md) is limited to 100,000 caps (in 4 networks), which creates long-term interest for collectors. Additionally, each cap has a rarity, with some being more exclusive than others.

To obtain a cap, players can [use a vending machine](./getting-started/04-get-caps-vending-machines.md) by [purchasing tickets](./getting-started/01-buy-tickets.md) and pushing the button to receive a random cap from the collection.

For more technical details, please refer to the ["Getting Started"](./getting-started/getting-started.md) section.

## Why we here?

Our motivation to create CAPS arose from the main problem in the current NFT market, which is that many buyers have no practical use for the images they purchase. 

In the CAPS game, however, you can actually [play with your collectibles](./getting-started/10-play.md), and as you do so, they gradually [lose quality](./getting-started/09-how-caps-loose-quality.md), forcing you to develop your own unique strategies within the game's economy.

> _"From useless to useful"._

Additionally, you don't have to wait for your ask/bid trade offers to be fulfilled. At any time, you can [burn caps for fungible tokens](./getting-started/11-get-token-burn-caps.md).

## Where we at?

Please note that CAPS operates on different [contracts](./smart-contracts/smart-contracts.md) across the Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, and Binance networks. This means you can choose your preferred blockchain to play on.

In addition to playing, you can also [trade your caps](./getting-started/07-trade-caps.md) on various NFT marketplaces. While we are widely represented on platforms like Elements, Blur or OpenSea, the decentralized nature of caps means that you can trade them anywhere.
