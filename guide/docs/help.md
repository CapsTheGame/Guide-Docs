# Help

Any problem can be solved. Just follow these steps.

## 1) Search the docs

_Speed: Fast_

This site is created to contain all information to help you. Don't be lazy and go through it first.

## 2) Check resolved known issues list

_Speed: Fast_

There are special paragraphs where we gather solutions for popular user problems.

You can search for them at the end of every guide page, for example ["Get caps: Resolved known issues"](./getting-started/04-get-caps-vending-machines.md#resolved-known-issues) where issues with caps looting are observed.

## 3) Ask the community

_Speed: Medium_

If you still experience the problem with CAPS, join one of our public channels: [Telegram↗](https://t.me/CapsWorldChat) or [Discord↗](https://discord.gg/WAY5ZDhBMW) and ask people for help.

## 4) Contact the team

_Speed: Slow_

If you think your question is important or unsolvable, or you want to leave feedback about your project experience, we'll be glad to speak with you [directly](contact-us.md).
