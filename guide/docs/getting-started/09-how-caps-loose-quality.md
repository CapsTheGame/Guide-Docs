# How caps loose quality

Each time a cap is used in a [match](10-play.md), its condition decreases by 0.50 from a maximum of 100. After 200 matches, the surface of the cap will be erased to its maximum, but the cap can still be used indefinitely (its condition will just repeatedly stay at 0).

Transferring caps to another address does not affect their condition.

Only successful games will decrease the condition of caps. Declining the offer to play or encountering errors during the transaction (such as gas-related issues) will not affect the condition of the caps.
