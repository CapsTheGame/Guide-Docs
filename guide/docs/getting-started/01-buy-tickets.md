## Price for 1st collection

The price of each ticket is tied to $3 US dollars, but the purchase will be made in the network's main currency (such as ETH for Ethereum, MATIC for Polygon, FTM for Fantom, or BNB for Binance). Achieved thanks to [Chainlink price feed↗](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/) oracles.

:::caution GAS PRICE 
When you buy tickets, your wallet will automatically propose a gas price. However, the network fee is not included in the ticket price and must be paid separately by you. Polygon fees are almost zero, but be aware that Ethereum gas costs for contract calls are much more.

## Price from 2nd to 34th collection

The fixed price of $3 USD only applies to the first collection ([Monsters 1](../collections/01-monsters.md)). After this sale, the economy will adjust to the basic value, and tickets for all subsequent collections will be sold at a fixed price in ![CAPS token logo](/img/token-logo.svg#token-logo) ([CAPS tokens](./11-get-token-burn-caps.md)). For example, ticket for the second collection will cost 13.125 ![CAPS token logo](/img/token-logo.svg#token-logo), ticket for the third collection will cost 6.5626 ![CAPS token logo](/img/token-logo.svg#token-logo), and so on.
