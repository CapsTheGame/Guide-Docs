# Unpack caps

Means to reveal caps that are hidden inside a wrapper.

If you receive a new cap that is wrapped or you transfer it to a different address, the wrapper will remain intact.

If you use the cap to [play a match](10-play.md), the wrapper will be broken.

Only successful games will result in the caps being unpacked by removing the wrapper. If you decline the offer to play or encounter errors during the transaction (such as gas-related issues), the caps will remain inside the wrapper and will not be unpacked.
